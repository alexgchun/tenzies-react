# Tenzies - React Project
This is the final guided project of the Learn React course on Scrimba. The design of the page was provided, however all code has been built from scratch. This project makes use of React components, and React hooks (useState and useEffect). It also makes use of two external react libraries, Nano ID and Confetti.
